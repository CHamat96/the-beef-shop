# The Beef Spot

A sample webpage for an italian beef restaurant

## About
I wanted to test myself with building a website using both Gatsby and a Headless CMS. After watching the entire first season of "The Bear" multiple times, I came up with the idea to make a website for a fake Italian Beef restaurant, using the various foods from the show as menu items in addition to a couple staples that are typically served at this type of restaurant.
